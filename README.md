# 📝 No Caption, No Problem: Caption-Free Membership Inference via Model-Fitted Embeddings
This repository contains the official implementation of **MoFit**, a caption-free MIA framework that constructs synthetic conditioning inputs that are explicitly overfitted to the target model's generative manifold
Our work will be presented at _ICLR 2026_ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Check out the project page and the paper!
